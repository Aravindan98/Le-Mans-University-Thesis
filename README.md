# This repository contains all the code and other material used in my thesis at Le Mans University
This repo contains all the code used in the Thesis.

Two methods are explored:
1. The Crank-Nicholson methods as illustrated by Poulsen. The folder FDM contains the code.
2. The Deep Galerkin Method. The folder DGM contains related code.

So far the following fokker-planck equation for the following processes have been solved numerically.
1. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
2. The Geometric Brownian Motion
3. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process
