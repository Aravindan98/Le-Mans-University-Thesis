Two methods are explored in this project:
1. The Crank-Nicholson methods as illustrated by Poulsen. Visit the FDM directory for the MATLAB scripts
2. The Deep Galerkin Method. Visit the DGM directory for the iPynb notebooks.

So far the following fokker-planck equation for the following processes have been solved numerically using both methods.
1. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
2. The Geometric Brownian Motion
3. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process

Please visit the respective folders to learn about these methods.
