# Undergraduate Thesis

This repo contains all the code and images for my thesis @Le Mans Universite.

Two methods are explored:
1. The Crank-Nicholson methods as illustrated by Poulsen. The directory FDM contains the code.
2. The Deep Galerkin Method. The directory DGM contains all related code.

So far the following fokker-planck equation for the following processes have been solved numerically.
1. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
2. The Geometric Brownian Motion
3. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process
