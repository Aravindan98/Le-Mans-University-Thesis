# Le Mans University thesis

This repo contains all the code and images for my thesis.

---
Two methods are explored in this project:
1. The Crank-Nicholson methods as illustrated by Poulsen. Visit the FDM directory for the MATLAB scripts
2. The Deep Galerkin Method. Visit the DGM directory for the iPynb notebooks.
3. The code for the Finite Element Methods was given by Professor. Alexandre Brouste of Le Mans University. It was modified for a case-by-case basis for each of the diffusion processes.

So far the following fokker-planck equation for the following processes have been solved numerically using both methods.
1. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
2. The Geometric Brownian Motion
3. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process
